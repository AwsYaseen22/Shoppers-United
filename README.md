## Aws notes:

### approach to a group:

1. create a group model (contains the users array)
2. add a groupId to the Todo model
3. populate users in the group so we could access user info when listing groups
4. create groups controller includes methods: getGroups, createGroup, showCreateGroup
5. create createGroup.ejs to handel create new group and get the group name
6. create groups.ejs view to list the groups list
7. when click on each group it take us to the group todos items
8. the groups filters by the user if he/she inside the group users array
9. each user can add a user to a specific group by adding their userId
10. user will now list all groups its id in the users array
